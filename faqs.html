                        <h3>When should I schedule my alteration?</h3>
                        <p>Schedule your first bridal alteration 8-12 weeks prior to your wedding day. This gives you plenty of time for a second fitting and also any changes you may desire prior to your special day.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h3>How many fittings will I need?</h3>
                        <p>Most of our fittings require 2 visits. On your second visit we will make sure everything is perfect, bust, waist, hips, hem, and bustle. We can work out any kinks after a second fitting. Unlike our competitors, we do not charge for any additional fittings!</p>
                     </div>

                    <div>
                        <h3>How long are fittings?</h3>
                        <p>The first fitting will be the longest, usually around 30-45 minutes. Second and third fittings are usually 20 minutes or less.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                     <h3>How long will it take to alter my dress?</h3>
                        <p>The total process can take several weeks, sometimes longer during the busiest times of wedding season (March-June). With an average of 2 fittings, this can span 6-8 weeks. Dresses requiring more extensive alterations like straps, bust, hips, bustle, etc will take longer. A hem, for example may take only 1 week. Rush option is available for last minute alterations. We try our very best to accommodate every bride.</p>

                        <h3>How many sizes can you take in?</h3>
                        <p>While every dress is unique and can vary, our experts can usually reduce a dress by 10 sizes.</p>
                    </div>

                   <div>
                        <h3>What if I plan on losing weight for the wedding?</h3>
                        <p>We will work with you. We are more than happy to modify the dress as needed for any last minute alterations secondary to weight loss.</p>

                   <div>

                        <p>We have room for all your guests. At the final fitting, we recommend you bring whoever will be buttoning your bustle at the wedding. Our master seamstresses will demonstrate to you and your guest how the bustle functions on your dress and will also allow time for practice.</p>
